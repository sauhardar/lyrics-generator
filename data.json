scarf there at your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\n\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n'Caus\u0435 there we ar\u0435 again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKeychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town\nAnd I was thinkin' on the drive down, \"Any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love,\" you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up\nRunnin' scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of bein' honest\nI'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weepin' in a party bathroom\nSome actress askin' me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my

scarf there at your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\n\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singing in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n'Cause there we are again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"fuck the patriarchy\"\nKey chain on the ground, we were always skipping town\nAnd I was thinking on the drive down, any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearing it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation\nMaybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\n'Til you tore it all up\nRunning scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest\nI'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weeping in a party bathroom\nSome actress asking me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSipping coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\nAnd I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you, too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well\nWind in my hair,

Who better for you than the boy, huh?\nI love me\nI love me enough for the both of us\nThat's why you trust me\nI know you been through more than most of us\nSo what are you\nWhat are you, what are you so afraid of?\nDarling, you\nYou give, but you cannot take love\nUh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures\nOr further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage\nWhen I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit\nA weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it\n'Cause that night I played her three songs\nThen we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on\nThen she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz\nBoy, was she wrong\nThat was just negative energy for me to feed off\nNow it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria\nOr Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria\nLandmarks of the muses that inspired the music\nWhen I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it\nThe one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree\nI've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me\nNow she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?\nKnow we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't?\nRemember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz\nGirl, I felt like we had it all planned out\nI guess I fucked up the vision\nLearning the true consequences of my selfish decisions\nWhen you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven\nIt seem like you don't want this love anymore\nI'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore\nBut girl, what qualities was I looking for before?\nWho you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?\nI love me\nI love me enough for the both of us\nThat's why you trust me\nI know you been through more than most of us\nSo what are you\nWhat are you, what are you so afraid of?\nDarling, you\nYou give, but you cannot take love\n\nBeen Baka aka Not Nice from time, G\nBeen a East Side ting\nScarborough ting from time, G\nBeen have up di ting dem from time, G\nSo I don't know what's wrong with these\nLittle wasteman out here, eh?\nY'all need to know yourself574Embed"

Fuck being normal!\nAnd I just bought a new raygun from the future\nJust to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad\n'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad\nSingin' to a man while he played piano\nMan, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel\nSo Ray J went straight to the radio station\nThe very next day, \"Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!\"\nLyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J.

Make lemonade then!\nBut if I can't batter the women\nHow the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!\nDon't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake\nIf you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation\nTo trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and\nDon't be a retard\u2014be a king?

and on the Louis V carpet\n\nIf you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand\n'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans\nI'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is\nThe motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)\nHow can I have all these fans and perspire?\nLike a liar's pants, I'm on fire\nAnd I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire\nThese chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer\nI got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers\nAnd what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw\n'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball\nLike Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy\n'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)\nBitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher\nWon't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care\nBut I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her\nFace in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez\nCristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well\nSo they wanna give me the chair\nLike a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari\n'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em\nSwearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious\nIt's time to put these bitches in the obituary column\nWe wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem\nGet the shaft like a steering column (Monster)\nTrigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink\nEvil half of the Bad Meets\nEvil, that means take a back seat\nTake it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single\nLook at my rap sheet, what attracts these people\nIs my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle\nI stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto\nFill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em\nOther words, I Minute Maid 'em\nI don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage\nI'm murderin' again, nobody will evade\nI'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake\nObliterating everything, incinerate a renegade\nI'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid\nBut don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway\n'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill\nI'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla\nYou're bringin' the killer within me outta me\nYou don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me\nAnd be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be\nEvery bit of me's the epitome of a spitter\nWhen I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck\nOr you finna be dead the minute you run into me\nA hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me\nI'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable\nYou wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable\nI'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable\nI'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full\nI'm not afraid to pull a\u2014\nMan, stop\nLook what I'm plannin', haha1.2KEmbed"

We should be together too\nMy tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I\nGot out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window\nAnd I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could it'd all be gray\nBut your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad\nDear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans\nThis'll be the last package I ever send your ass\nIt's been six months, and still no word\u2014I don't deserve it?\nI know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect\nSo this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it\nI'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway\nHey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?\nYou know the song by Phil Collins, \"In the Air of the Night\"\nAbout that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'\nBut didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?\nThat's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'\nNow it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now\u2014I'm drowsy\nAnd all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call\nI hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall\nI loved you, Slim, we coulda been together\u2014think about it!\nYou ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it\nAnd when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it\nI hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me\nSee, Slim\u2014shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk\nHey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk\nBut I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up\u2014see? I ain't like you\n\u2018Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too\nWell, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now\nOh, shit, I forgot\u2014how am I supposed to send this shit out?!\nMy tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I\nGot out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window\nAnd I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could it'd all be gray\nBut your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad\n\nDear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy\nYou said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?\nLook, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that\nAnd here's an autograph for your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap\nI'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you\nDon't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you\nBut what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?\nI say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?\nYou got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'\nTo help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some\nAnd what's this shit about us meant to be together?\nThat type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other\nI really think you and your girlfriend need each other\nOr maybe you just need to treat her better\nI hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time\nBefore you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine\nIf you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan\nWhy are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan\nI just don't want you to do some crazy shit\nI seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick\nSome dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge\nAnd had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid\nAnd in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to\nCome to think about it, his name was\u2014it was you\n\nDamn\u2026641Embed"

Perhaps\nUntil my legs, until my legs\nI'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse\nGive out from underneath me\nSoon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart\nWhat is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart\nAnd it's absurd how people hang on every word\nI'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve\nBut I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved\nIf I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first\n\u2018Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse\nThat's why I'm clever when I put together every verse\nMy thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict\nI rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers\nBut I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles\nThe fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers\nSo this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em\nThe track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?\n\u2018Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters\nA plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so\n'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out\n'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth\n'Til the smoke clears out, am I high?

You embarrassed?\nThis guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence\nAnd Clarence lives at home with both parents\nAnd Clarence' parents have a real good marriage\nThis guy don't wanna battle, he's shook\n'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks\nHe's scared to death, he's scared to look\nAt his fucking yearbook; fuck Cranbrook!\nFuck a beat, I'll go a cappella\nFuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer\nFuck everybody! Fuck y'all if you doubt me!\nI'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly\nAnd fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie\nHere, tell these people something they don't know about me\nYo...249Embed"

Is it the bar I set?\nMy arms, I stretch, but I can\u2019t reach\nA far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as\nSoon as I grab, squeeze\nI lose my grip like the flying trapeze\nInto the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening\nI know the mark\u2019s high, butter\u2013\nFlies rip apart my stomach\nKnowin' that no matter what bars I come with\nYou're gonna harp, gripe, and\nThat's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these\nAs pressure increases like khakis\nI feel the ice cracking, because\u2014\nI walk on water\nBut I ain't no Jesus\n(It's the curse of the\u2014, it's the curse of the\u2014)\nI walk on water (Shit)\nBut only when it freezes\n\nIt's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set\nAlways in search of the verse that I haven\u2019t spit yet\nWill this step just be another misstep\nTo tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect\nI\u2019ve garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless\nAnd it always feels like I'm hittin\u2019 the mark\n'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart\nLike, \"This shit is garbage!\"\nGod's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless\nKids look to me as a god, this is retarded\nIf only they knew, it's a facade and it\u2019s exhaustive\nAnd I try not to listen to nonsense\nBut if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence\nMission accomplished\nI'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith\nAnd I'm not Prince, so\u2026\n\nI walk on water\nBut I ain't no Jesus\nI walk on water\n(It's true, I'm a Rubik's\u2014, it's true\u2014)\nBut only when it freezes\n(It's true\u2014)\n'Cause I'm only human, just like you\nMaking my mistakes, oh if you only knew\nI don't think you should believe in me the way that you do\n'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh\n\nIt's true, I'm a Rubik's\u2014a beautiful mess\nAt times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest\nA flawed human, I guess\nBut I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex\u2013\nPectations and meet 'em, but first\nThe \"Speedom\" verse, now Big Sean\nHe's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?\nThere was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm\nEvery album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on\nAnd now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on\nBut the only one who's looking down on\nMe that matters now's DeShaun\nAm I lucky to be around this long?\nBegs the question though\nEspecially after the methadone\nAs yesterday fades and the Dresden home\nIs burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn\nThe crowds are gone\nAnd it's time to wash out the blonde\nSales decline, the curtain's drawn\nThey're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind\nAnd everyone who has doubt, remind\nNow take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times\nNow let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares\nOr gives a fuck about your rhymes\nAnd as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine\n'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight\nWhen I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?\nBut when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine\nI won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine\nBut I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause\u2014\nI walk on water\nBut I ain't no Jesus\nI walk on water\nBut only when it freezes\n\n'Cause I'm only human, just like you\nI've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew\nI don't think you should believe in me the way that you do\n'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh\nIf I walked on water, I would drown\n\n'Cause I'm just a man\nBut as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike\nSo me and you are not alike\nBitch, I wrote \"Stan\"440Embed"
